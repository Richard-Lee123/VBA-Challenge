# VBA-Challenge

---

  In this Challenge I will be analyzing data from our "Multiple Year Stock Data" excel sheet. The data includes stock tickers, dates, opening prices, closing prices, highs, lows, and volume. All of this data will be coming from the years of 2014 to 2016. My analysis will include findings for each stock, which will be indicated by the ticker. I will be looking for the yearly change, the percentage of change per year, and the total stock volume per year. I will also look for the greates increase and decrease in value for each year, along with the greatest total volume for the year.
 
 Using Excel's Visual Basic for Applications I was able to make a set of code that will give me the results that I was looking for. This code can be found in the VBA Code.bas, the code was also tested on the alphabetical_testing.xlsm file before used on the "Multiple Year Stock Data." This was due to how large the stock data file was. Also because the file was so large I only included a few screenshots to show a brief finding of the data.
