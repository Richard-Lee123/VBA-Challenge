# VBA-Challenge

---

  In this Challenge I will be analyzing data from our "Multiple Year Stock Data" excel sheet. The data includes stock tickers, dates, opening prices, closing prices, highs, lows, and volume. All of this data will be coming from the years of 2014 to 2016. My analysis will include findings for each stock, which will be indicated by the ticker. I will be looking for the yearly change, the percentage of change per year, and the total stock volume per year. I will also look for the greates increase and decrease in value for each year, along with the greatest total volume for the year.
